- [ ] Mockups or screenshots are included if relevant

## Metadata Verification

### Labels

- [ ] Type label is applied (feature, bug, enhancement, documentation, task)

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **During Issue Creation**: Use this checklist while creating each issue to
   ensure all elements are properly included.
2. **Batch Verification**: After creating a set of issues, use this checklist to
   verify consistency across the set.
3. **Periodic Audits**: Periodically review existing issues using this checklist
   to maintain issue quality over time.

By consistently applying this verification process, the project will maintain
high-quality issues that provide clear direction for implementation and ensure
proper tracking of work.

## Example Issues for Reference
