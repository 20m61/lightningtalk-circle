# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

The Lightning Talk Circle website aims to be fully accessible to all users,
regardless of disabilities or assistive technologies used. These guidelines
ensure that our platform adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA level standards and provides an
inclusive experience for everyone.

## Standards Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Conformance

The website will conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
Level AA standards. This includes meeting all Level A and AA success criteria:

- **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable
  to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must
  be understandable.
- **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety
  of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implementation Requirements

### Semantic HTML Structure

- Use HTML5 semantic elements appropriately to convey document structure:
  - `<header>` for the site header and page headers
  - `<nav>` for navigation menus
  - `<main>` for the primary content area
  - `<article>` for self-contained compositions
  - `<section>` for thematic grouping of content
  - `<aside>` for tangentially related content
  - `<footer>` for site footer and sectional footers
  - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images with captions

- Implement a logical heading structure:
  - Use `<h1>` for the main page title (only one per page)
  - Follow sequential order for headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
  - Don't skip heading levels

- Set appropriate language attributes:
  - `lang="ja"` on the `<html>` element
  - Use `lang` attributes on elements that change language

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible:
  - All interactive elements can be reached using the Tab key
  - Logical tab order follows the visual layout
  - Custom components implement appropriate keyboard interactions

- Implement visible focus indicators:
  - Clear visual indication of keyboard focus on all interactive elements
  - Focus indicators must have sufficient contrast (3:1 minimum)
  - No focus traps except for modal dialogs (which must trap focus
    appropriately)

- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions:
  - Document all keyboard shortcuts
  - Allow users to disable or remap keyboard shortcuts

### Images and Media

- Provide alternative text for images:
  - Descriptive `alt` text for informative images
  - Empty `alt=""` for decorative images
  - Complex images should have extended descriptions

- Ensure multimedia accessibility:
  - Captions for video content
  - Transcripts for audio content
  - No auto-playing media without user control
  - Controls for pausing, stopping, and adjusting volume

### Color and Contrast

- Maintain sufficient color contrast:
  - Text and images of text have contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
  - Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) has contrast ratio of at least 3:1
  - User interface components and graphical objects have contrast ratio of at
    least 3:1

- Don't rely solely on color:
  - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information
  - Additional indicators (text, icons, patterns) supplement color coding
  - Interactive elements have visible focus and hover states beyond color
    changes

### Forms and Input

- Implement proper form labeling:
  - Every form control has an associated `<label>` element
  - Labels are visually connected to their controls
  - Required fields are indicated both visually and programmatically

- Provide clear error identification:
  - Error messages are specific and descriptive
  - Errors are identified by text, not just color
  - Form validation errors are announced to screen readers
  - Suggestions for correction are provided when possible

- Group related form elements:
  - Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for groups of related controls
  - Implement logical grouping in complex forms

### ARIA Implementation

Apply ARIA roles and properties appropriately and only when necessary:

- **Landmarks:**
  - `role="banner"` for the main header (or use `<header>`)
  - `role="navigation"` for navigation menus (or use `<nav>`)
  - `role="main"` for main content (or use `<main>`)
  - `role="complementary"` for supporting content (or use `<aside>`)
  - `role="contentinfo"` for footer information (or use `<footer>`)
  - `role="search"` for search functionality

- **Dynamic Content:**
  - `aria-live="polite"` for content that updates automatically
  - `aria-atomic="true"` when the entire region should be announced
  - `aria-busy="true"` during loading states

- **Interactive Elements:**
  - `aria-expanded` for expandable elements
  - `aria-controls` to associate controls with what they affect
  - `aria-haspopup` for elements that trigger popups
  - `aria-selected` for selection states
  - `aria-checked` for toggle/checkbox states

- **Form Elements:**
  - `aria-required="true"` for required inputs
  - `aria-invalid="true"` for fields with validation errors
  - `aria-describedby` to associate inputs with help text or error messages

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Navigation

- Implement "Skip to Main Content" link as the first focusable element
- Provide multiple ways to navigate the site (menu, search, sitemap)
- Ensure current page is indicated in navigation menus
- Support keyboard navigation in complex menu structures

### Date Coordination Function

- Make voting buttons fully keyboard accessible
- Ensure calendar view is navigable with keyboard
- Provide table or list view as alternative to calendar display
- Include text explanation alongside visual vote indicators

### Event Management Function

- Ensure form fields for event registration have clear labels
- Provide text alternatives for map locations
- Make timetable information accessible as structured data
- Create keyboard-accessible file upload interfaces

### Presentation Archive Function

- Provide text descriptions of presentation content
- Ensure PDF materials are accessible (or provide accessible alternatives)
- Implement accessible video players with keyboard controls
- Make search and filtering interfaces work with keyboard and screen readers

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing

- Implement Storybook's `@storybook/addon-a11y` for component-level testing
