# Issue Implementation Guide

This guide provides concrete steps for implementing the issues creation process
outlined in the issue planning documents. This document serves as a practical
implementation manual to turn the planning documents into actual GitHub issues.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Lightning Talk Circle GitHub repository with write permissions
- Node.js 14.x or later (if using the automated script approach)
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

## Steps to Create All Planned Issues

### Method 1: Using the Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Set up your environment**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository if you haven't already
   git clone https://github.com/20m61/lightningtalk-circle.git
   cd lightningtalk-circle

   # Install required dependencies
   npm install @octokit/rest dotenv

   # Create a .env file with your GitHub token
   echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token" > .env
   ```

2. **Review the issues data**

   Before creating issues, review the data in `docs/project/issues-data.json` to
   ensure it reflects the current project requirements. This file contains the
   complete data for all issues to be created, organized by category.

3. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   node scripts/create-issues.js
   ```

   The script will:
   - Check for existing issues in the repository
   - Prompt for confirmation before creating new issues
   - Create all issues defined in the data file
   - Apply appropriate labels to each issue

4. **Verify the created issues**

   After running the script, verify the issues in GitHub to ensure they were
   created correctly and have the appropriate labels, descriptions, and
   metadata.

### Method 2: Manual Creation

If you prefer to create issues manually or encounter issues with the script:

1. **Prepare the GitHub repository**
   - Navigate to the
     [Lightning Talk Circle repository](https://github.com/20m61/lightningtalk-circle)
   - Go to the "Issues" tab
   - Make sure all required labels are set up according to the
     [Issue Labels](/docs/project/issue-labels.md) document

2. **Create infrastructure/foundation issues**

   For each issue listed in the
   [Initial Issues - Infrastructure/Foundation section](/docs/project/initial-issues.md#infrastructurefoundation-issues-p0):
   - Click "New issue"
   - Select the "General Issue" template
   - Copy the title and content from the document
   - Apply the appropriate labels:
     - `type:task` or `type:documentation`
     - `priority:critical` or `priority:high`
     - `component:infrastructure`
     - `status:backlog`
   - Submit the issue

3. **Create core feature issues**

   For each issue listed in the
   [Initial Issues - Core Feature section](/docs/project/initial-issues.md#core-feature-issues-p1):
   - Click "New issue"
   - Select the "Feature Request" template
   - Copy the title and content from the document
   - Apply the appropriate labels:
     - `type:feature`
     - `priority:high`
     - Appropriate component label (e.g., `component:eventmanagement`)
     - `status:backlog`
   - Submit the issue

4. **Create enhancement and optimization issues**

   For each issue listed in the
   [Initial Issues - Enhancement section](/docs/project/initial-issues.md#enhancement-and-optimization-issues-p2):
   - Click "New issue"
   - Select the "Feature Request" template
   - Copy the title and content from the document
   - Apply the appropriate labels:
     - `type:enhancement`
     - `priority:medium`
     - Appropriate component label
     - `status:backlog`
   - Submit the issue

5. **Create compliance and maintenance issues**

   For each issue listed in the
   [Initial Issues - Compliance section](/docs/project/initial-issues.md#compliance-and-maintenance-issues-p2p3):
   - Click "New issue"
   - Select the "General Issue" template
   - Copy the title and content from the document
   - Apply the appropriate labels:
     - `type:task`
     - `priority:medium` or `priority:low`
     - Appropriate component label
     - `status:backlog`
   - Submit the issue

## Verifying Issue Quality and Consistency

After creating all issues, verify them using the
[Issue Verification Checklist](/docs/project/issue-verification-checklist.md):

1. **Content verification**
   - Ensure all issues have clear titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria
   - Verify that all template sections are filled out appropriately

2. **Label verification**
   - Check that all issues have the appropriate type, priority, component, and
     status labels
   - Verify that the labels are consistent with the issue content

3. **Organization verification**
   - If using GitHub Projects, ensure all issues are added to the appropriate
     project board
   - Verify that dependencies between issues are properly identified and linked

## Setting Up GitHub Actions for Label Management

To maintain consistency with issue labels, you can use the provided GitHub
Actions workflow:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the repository
2. Click on "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
5. Click "Run workflow" to create or update all labels according to the
   `.github/labels.yml` file

## Next Steps After Issue Creation

Once all issues are created:

1. **Prioritize the backlog**
   - Review all issues and confirm their priority
   - Organize issues into milestones if applicable

2. **Assign initial issues**
   - Assign the highest priority infrastructure issues to team members
   - Plan the first development sprint

3. **Create project board**
   - Set up a GitHub Projects board with appropriate columns
   - Add all issues to the board in the "Backlog" column

4. **Document the roadmap**
   - Create a project roadmap based on the prioritized issues
   - Share with stakeholders for alignment

By following this guide, you will successfully implement the comprehensive issue
creation plan and establish a solid foundation for the Lightning Talk Circle
project's development workflow.
