# Issue Creation Execution Guide

This document provides the final implementation steps to execute the issue
creation process for the Lightning Talk Circle project. It serves as a concise
execution checklist based on all the documentation and tools already developed.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository access with write permissions
- Node.js environment (version 14.x or higher)
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

## Execution Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Labels

Before creating issues, establish the standardized label system:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. Go to the "Actions" tab
3. Find and select the "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
6. Click "Run workflow"

This will create all the standard labels defined in `.github/labels.yml`.

### 2. Create All Issues

Choose one of the following methods to create the issues:

#### Option A: Automated Creation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository (if not already done):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/20m61/lightningtalk-circle.git
   cd lightningtalk-circle
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @octokit/rest dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your GitHub token:

   ```bash
   echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token" > .env
   ```

4. Run the issue creation script:

   ```bash
   node scripts/create-issues.js
   ```

5. Review the console output to verify all issues were created successfully

#### Option B: Manual Creation

If you prefer to create issues manually or encounter issues with the script:

1. Follow the detailed steps in
   [Issue Implementation Guide](/docs/project/issue-implementation-guide.md)
2. Create each issue type by type, following the priority order:
   - Infrastructure/foundation issues
   - Core feature issues
   - Enhancement and optimization issues
   - Compliance and maintenance issues

### 3. Verify Issue Creation

After creating all issues:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Verify all issues have been created with:
   - Correct titles and descriptions
   - Appropriate labels (type, priority, component, status)
   - Complete acceptance criteria
   - Well-formatted content

3. Use the
   [Issue Verification Checklist](/docs/project/issue-verification-checklist.md)
   to validate consistency

### 4. Organize Project Board (Optional)

To better visualize and manage the workflow:

1. Go to the "Projects" tab in the repository
2. Create a new project board (if not already existing)
3. Organize issues into the appropriate columns:
   - Backlog
   - Ready for development
   - In progress
   - Under review
   - Done

## Summary of Created Issues

The following issues have been prepared for creation:

### Infrastructure/Foundation Issues (P0)

- Set up development environment and tools
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Set up documentation structure and standards

### Core Feature Issues (P1)

- Implement event creation and announcement system
- Build event registration system
- Develop presentation submission system

### Enhancement and Optimization Issues (P2)

- Implement in-site feedback mechanisms
- Create presenter dashboard for content management

### Compliance and Maintenance Issues (P2/P3)

- Implement accessibility standards compliance
- Create data retention and privacy compliance procedures

## Next Steps After Issue Creation

1. **Prioritize the backlog**
   - Review all issues and confirm their priority
   - Organize issues into milestones if applicable

2. **Begin implementation**
   - Assign the highest priority infrastructure issues to team members
   - Plan the first development sprint

3. **Track progress**
   - Regularly update issue status as work progresses
   - Use the project board to visualize workflow

By following this execution guide, you will complete the issue creation process
and establish a solid foundation for the Lightning Talk Circle project's
development.
