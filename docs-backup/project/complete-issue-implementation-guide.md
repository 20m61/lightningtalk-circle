# Complete Issue Implementation Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process for implementing all planned issues
for the Lightning Talk Circle project, taking into account potential GitHub
Actions issues and providing robust alternatives.

## Step 1: Set Up Issue Labels

Before creating issues, set up the standardized label system.

### Option A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the repository
2. Select the "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
5. Click "Run workflow" to execute

### Option B: Manual Setup (If GitHub Actions Fails)

If GitHub Actions encounters issues:

1. Install GitHub CLI and authenticate:

   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI (varies by platform)
   gh auth login
   ```

2. For each label in `.github/labels.yml`: Create the label manually:
   ```bash
   gh label create "priority:high" --color "D93F0B" --description "P1 issues with high importance" --force
   ```

## Step 2: Create Issues

With labels in place, create the defined issues.

### Option A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the repository
2. Select the "Create GitHub Issues" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
5. Optionally specify a category to create only specific issues
6. Click "Run workflow" to execute

The workflow includes:

- Retry logic to handle transient failures
- Fallback to GitHub CLI if the primary method fails
- Detailed error reporting

### Option B: Using Node.js Script Locally

If GitHub Actions is not available:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @octokit/rest dotenv chalk
   ```

3. Create `.env` file with GitHub token:

   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/create-issues.js
   ```

### Option C: Using Shell Script Locally

For a simpler approach:

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/create-issues-local.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-issues-local.sh
   ```

### Option D: Manual Creation

If automation is not working:

1. Open the repository's "Issues" tab
2. Click "New issue"
3. Select an appropriate template
4. Refer to `docs/project/issues-data.json` for issue content
5. Create issues according to the structure in the JSON file

## Step 3: Verify Issues

Validate that all issues were created correctly.

### Option A: Using Verification Script

```bash
node scripts/verify-issues.js
```

This will:

- Compare created issues against expected issues
- Check labels and metadata
- Report any discrepancies

### Option B: Manual Verification

1. Open the repository's "Issues" tab
2. Compare against `docs/project/issues-data.json`
3. Check that each issue has the correct:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Labels
   - Priority indicators

## Step 4: Organize Issues

Once all issues are created, organize them for efficient development.

1. Create a GitHub Project board for tracking
2. Group issues by category:
   - Infrastructure/Foundation
   - Core Features
   - Enhancements/Optimizations
   - Compliance/Maintenance

3. Prioritize issues based on dependencies and importance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. GitHub Actions: 400 Bad Request

**Solution:**

- Check troubleshooting guide:
  [GitHub Actions Troubleshooting](/docs/project/github-actions-troubleshooting.md)
- Configure actions setup steps to run before firewall:
  [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps)
- Add URLs to firewall allow list:
  [Firewall config](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)

#### 2. Rate Limiting

**Solution:**

- Use the category parameter to create issues in batches
- Add delays between API calls when using scripts
- Distribute creation over multiple runs

#### 3. Permission Issues

**Solution:**

- Ensure the GitHub token has write permissions for issues
- In repository settings, ensure Actions have "Read and write permissions"
