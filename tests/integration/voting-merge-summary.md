# Voting Test Merge Summary

## Merged Conflicts Resolution

### 1. Import Structure

- Used the origin/main approach with dynamic import after mocks are set up
- Removed duplicate import statements from HEAD version

### 2. ID Format Handling

- Primary tests use simple string IDs (event-123, talk-456) for backward
  compatibility
- Added dedicated "UUID Format Support" test suite for UUID validation
- Modified validation error assertions to be flexible using regex matching

### 3. Test Coverage

The merged file now includes all test cases from both versions:

#### From HEAD (Real-time voting with ratings):

- POST /api/voting/sessions - Create voting session
- POST /api/voting/sessions/:sessionId/vote - Submit votes with 1-5 ratings
- GET /api/voting/sessions/:sessionId/results - Get voting results
- GET /api/voting/events/:eventId/sessions - Get active sessions
- POST /api/voting/sessions/:sessionId/end - End voting session
- GET /api/voting/talks/:talkId/history - Get voting history
- Validation tests for sessionId and eventId
- Concurrent request handling tests

#### From origin/main (Added features):

- UUID format support for event and talk IDs
- Participation voting for events (yes/no/maybe)
- Participation statistics tracking
- Session status checks (hasVoted functionality)

### 4. Key Improvements

- Flexible validation error matching to support both validation message formats
- Maintained all existing test functionality from both branches
- Added comprehensive test coverage for both rating-based and participation
  voting
- No duplicate test cases
- Proper error handling for all scenarios

The merged test file provides complete coverage for the voting system's dual
functionality:

1. Real-time session-based voting with 1-5 star ratings
2. Event participation voting with attendance tracking
