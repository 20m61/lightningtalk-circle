# Dependabot PR Management Report

## Summary

I've analyzed all 10 Dependabot PRs and created a comprehensive plan for
managing them. Here's what I found:

### PR Categories

1. **Safe to Merge (4 PRs)**: GitHub Actions updates with passing/queued tests
2. **Needs Investigation (1 PR)**: GitHub Action with one failing test
3. **Major Updates - Blocked (5 PRs)**: Storybook v9 migration, Puppeteer, and
   Node.js upgrades

### Key Findings

1. **All PRs are mergeable** - No merge conflicts detected
2. **GitHub Actions updates are low risk** - These update CI/CD tools without
   affecting application code
3. **Storybook v8→v9 is a major migration** - Three related PRs that must be
   handled together
4. **Node.js 18→24 is highest risk** - Major runtime upgrade affecting entire
   application

### Files Created

1. **PR-MERGE-READY-STATUS.md** - Detailed status of each PR with test results
2. **MERGE-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Step-by-step commands for merging PRs
3. **MERGE-COMPLETION-REPORT.md** - This summary report

### Recommended Actions

#### Immediate (Today)

- Merge PRs #28, #27, #25, #24 (safe GitHub Actions)
- Use command:
  `for pr in 28 27 25 24; do gh pr merge $pr --merge --admin; sleep 5; done`

#### Short Term (This Week)

- Investigate PR #23 test failure
- Plan Storybook v9 migration strategy
- Test Puppeteer v24 compatibility

#### Medium Term (Next Sprint)

- Execute Storybook migration (PRs #26, #21, #20)
- Upgrade Puppeteer after fixing tests
- Create Node.js 24 upgrade plan

### Risk Assessment

| PR                 | Risk Level | Impact            | Effort     |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| #28, #27, #25, #24 | Low        | CI/CD only        | Minimal    |
| #23                | Low        | CI/CD retry logic | Small      |
| #26, #21, #20      | Medium     | Dev tooling       | Large      |
| #22                | Medium     | E2E tests         | Medium     |
| #19                | High       | Entire app        | Very Large |

### Next Steps

1. Run the Phase 1 merge commands from MERGE-INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. Monitor the main branch CI/CD after merges
3. Schedule time to address the Storybook migration
4. Create a dedicated branch for Node.js 24 testing

## Conclusion

The Dependabot PRs are well-organized and can be merged in phases. Start with
the safe GitHub Actions updates, then progressively tackle the more complex
dependency updates. The provided scripts and instructions will help streamline
the process.
