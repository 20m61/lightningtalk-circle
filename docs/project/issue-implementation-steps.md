# Issue Implementation Steps

This document provides the final concrete steps to implement the planned issues in GitHub. This is the culmination of all the planning, documentation, and tools we've created.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope
- Node.js installed (version 14.x or later)
- Access to the Lightning Talk Circle GitHub repository

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

If you don't already have a GitHub token with appropriate permissions:

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
3. Click "Generate new token" (classic)
4. Give your token a descriptive name
5. Select the `repo` scope
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy and save the token immediately** (it won't be shown again)

## Step 2: Set Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/20m61/lightningtalk-circle.git
   cd lightningtalk-circle
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @octokit/rest dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your GitHub token:
   ```bash
   echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token" > .env
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up GitHub Labels

Before creating issues, establish the standardized label system using either method:

### Option A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. Go to the "Actions" tab
3. Find and select the "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
6. Click "Run workflow"

### Option B: Using API (Alternative)

You can use the GitHub API to create labels programmatically:

```bash
# Example using curl to create a label
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/20m61/lightningtalk-circle/labels \
  -d '{"name":"type:feature","color":"0E8A16","description":"New functionality being added to the application"}'
```

## Step 4: Create All Issues

### Option A: Using the Automated Script (Recommended)

Run the issue creation script:

```bash
node scripts/create-issues.js
```

The script will:
- Check for existing issues in the repository
- Prompt for confirmation before creating new issues
- Create all issues defined in the data file
- Apply appropriate labels to each issue

### Option B: Manual Creation (Alternative)

If you prefer to create issues manually:

1. **Create infrastructure/foundation issues**:
   - Go to the repository's "Issues" tab
   - Click "New issue" 
   - Select the appropriate template
   - Copy content from the `issues-data.json` file
   - Apply appropriate labels
   - Submit the issue
   - Repeat for all infrastructure issues

2. **Create core feature issues**:
   - Follow the same process, using content from the "core_feature_issues" section
   
3. **Create enhancement and optimization issues**:
   - Follow the same process, using content from the "enhancement_optimization_issues" section
   
4. **Create compliance and maintenance issues**:
   - Follow the same process, using content from the "compliance_maintenance_issues" section

## Step 5: Verify Issue Creation

After creating all issues:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Verify all issues have been created with:
   - Correct titles and descriptions
   - Appropriate labels (type, priority, component, status)
   - Complete acceptance criteria
   - Well-formatted content

3. Use the [Issue Verification Checklist](/docs/project/issue-verification-checklist.md) to validate consistency

## Step 6: Organize Project Board (Optional)

To better visualize and manage the issues:

1. Go to the "Projects" tab in the repository
2. Create a new project board (if not already existing)
3. Add all created issues to the board
4. Organize issues by priority and category

## Summary of Steps

1. ✅ Create GitHub token with appropriate permissions
2. ✅ Set up environment and install dependencies
3. ✅ Set up standardized labels
4. ✅ Create all planned issues (automated or manual)
5. ✅ Verify issue quality and consistency
6. ✅ Organize issues in project board (optional)

By following these concrete implementation steps, you will complete the issue creation process for the Lightning Talk Circle project.
