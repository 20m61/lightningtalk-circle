# Issue Creation Process

This document outlines the standard process for creating issues in the Lightning Talk Circle project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency and completeness in our issue tracking.

## When to Create Issues

Issues should be created for:

1. New features or enhancements
2. Bugs or defects
3. Documentation updates
4. Technical debt items
5. Performance improvements
6. Accessibility compliance tasks
7. Security concerns

## Issue Creation Steps

### 1. Check for Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue:
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Review related issues to understand dependencies

### 2. Select the Appropriate Template

Choose the correct template based on the type of issue:
- **Feature Request**: For new functionality or improvements
- **Bug Report**: For defects or unexpected behavior
- **General Issue**: For tasks, documentation, or other work items

### 3. Complete All Required Fields

Ensure all template fields are completed with detailed information:
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Include user stories for feature requests
- Provide specific acceptance criteria
- Link to relevant documentation
- Add implementation notes when applicable

### 4. Apply Appropriate Labels

Add labels to categorize the issue:
- Type (feature, bug, enhancement, etc.)
- Priority level
- Component area
- Status

### 5. Set Additional Metadata

When applicable, include:
- Milestone assignment
- Assignee (if known)
- Due date (if applicable)
- Time estimate

### 6. Provide Context

Add any additional context that helps understand the issue:
- Screenshots or mockups
- Links to related issues
- External references
- Technical constraints

## Issue Writing Best Practices

### Clear Titles

- Be specific and descriptive
- Include the feature area or component
- Use action verbs (Create, Implement, Fix, etc.)
- Keep under 80 characters

**Good**: "Implement email notification system for event registration"
**Bad**: "Add notifications"

### Detailed Descriptions

- Provide enough context for someone unfamiliar with the task
- Explain the "why" behind the request
- Include background information when relevant
- Use formatting (headers, lists, code blocks) for readability

### Specific Acceptance Criteria

- Make criteria testable and verifiable
- Be explicit about expected behavior
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider different user types and permissions

### Implementation Notes

- Include technical considerations
- Mention potential approaches
- Note dependencies or prerequisites
- Highlight areas requiring special attention

## Example Issues

For examples of well-written issues, refer to the [Issue Examples](/docs/project/issue-examples.md) document.

## Issue Prioritization

Issues are prioritized based on:
- Strategic importance
- User impact
- Dependencies
- Implementation complexity

For detailed information on priority levels and the prioritization process, see the [Issue Management Workflow](/docs/project/issue-management-workflow.md) document.
