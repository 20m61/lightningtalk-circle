# Issue Creation Execution Guide

This guide provides the final steps to execute the issue creation process for the Lightning Talk Circle project. This document complements the [Issue Implementation Steps](/docs/project/issue-implementation-steps.md) by providing a concise checklist for the implementation team.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Issue templates have been created (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
- [x] Issue data has been prepared (docs/project/issues-data.json)
- [x] Issue creation script has been developed (scripts/create-issues.js)
- [x] Issue verification script has been developed (scripts/verify-issues.js)
- [x] Label configuration has been defined (.github/labels.yml)
- [x] Label setup workflow has been created (.github/workflows/setup-labels.yml)
- [x] Issue creation workflow has been created (.github/workflows/create-issues.yml)

## Execution Steps

### Option 1: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Set Up Labels**
   - [ ] Navigate to the GitHub repository
   - [ ] Go to the "Actions" tab
   - [ ] Find and run the "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
   - [ ] Enter "yes" when prompted for confirmation

2. **Create Issues**
   - [ ] Go to the "Actions" tab
   - [ ] Find and run the "Create GitHub Issues" workflow
   - [ ] Enter "yes" when prompted for confirmation
   - [ ] Wait for the workflow to complete (this may take a few minutes)
   - [ ] Check the workflow run logs to ensure all issues were created successfully

3. **Verify Issues**
   - [ ] The verification will run automatically as part of the issue creation workflow
   - [ ] Review the verification results in the workflow summary
   - [ ] If any issues are missing or have problems, address them manually

### Option 2: Using Command Line (Alternative)

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - [ ] Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/20m61/lightningtalk-circle.git
     cd lightningtalk-circle
     ```
   - [ ] Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install @octokit/rest dotenv chalk
     ```
   - [ ] Create a `.env` file with your GitHub token:
     ```bash
     echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token" > .env
     ```

2. **Set Up Labels**
   - [ ] Run the GitHub Action for label setup as described above, or
   - [ ] Use the GitHub API to create labels manually

3. **Create Issues**
   - [ ] Run the issue creation script:
     ```bash
     node scripts/create-issues.js
     ```
   - [ ] When prompted, type 'y' to confirm issue creation
   - [ ] Wait for the script to complete

4. **Verify Issues**
   - [ ] Run the verification script:
     ```bash
     node scripts/verify-issues.js
     ```
   - [ ] Review the verification results
   - [ ] If any issues are missing or have problems, address them manually

## Post-Creation Steps

1. **Organize Issues**
   - [ ] Create a GitHub Project Board (if not already existing)
   - [ ] Add all created issues to the project board
   - [ ] Organize issues by priority and category

2. **Assign Initial Issues**
   - [ ] Identify high-priority issues for immediate work
   - [ ] Assign these issues to appropriate team members
   - [ ] Set milestone targets for completion

3. **Document Issue Creation Completion**
   - [ ] Update the project documentation to reflect that issues have been created
   - [ ] Notify the team that issues are ready for work

## Troubleshooting

- **API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limit issues, spread out the creation over time
- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your token has the 'repo' scope
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `npm install` again to ensure all packages are installed
- **Script Errors**: Check the script error messages and address any specific issues
