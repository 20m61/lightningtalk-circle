# Issue Management and Creation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the issue management system for the Lightning Talk Circle project. It serves as the starting point for understanding how to create, manage, and track issues throughout the project lifecycle.

## üìö Documentation Structure

The issue management system is documented in the following files:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Issue Creation Plan](/docs/project/issue-creation-plan.md) | Outlines the issues to be created, organized by category and priority |
| [Issue Examples](/docs/project/issue-examples.md) | Provides examples of well-formatted issues of various types |
| [Initial Issues](/docs/project/initial-issues.md) | Contains the content for the first set of GitHub issues to be created |
| [Issue Management Workflow](/docs/project/issue-management-workflow.md) | Describes the workflow for managing issues throughout their lifecycle |
| [Issue Labels](/docs/project/issue-labels.md) | Defines the standard labels to be used for GitHub issues |
| [Issue Verification Checklist](/docs/project/issue-verification-checklist.md) | Provides a checklist to ensure issues maintain consistent formatting |
| [Issue Implementation Guide](/docs/project/issue-implementation-guide.md) | Provides step-by-step instructions for creating the planned issues |
| [Issue Execution Guide](/docs/project/issue-execution-guide.md) | A concise execution checklist to implement the issue creation process |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources

The following tools are provided to help implement the issue management system:

- **Label Configuration**: `.github/labels.yml` defines all issue labels in a format compatible with GitHub Actions
- **Label Setup Workflow**: `.github/workflows/setup-labels.yml` automates the creation of issue labels
- **Issue Creation Script**: `scripts/create-issues.js` automates the creation of issues from the issues data file
- **Issue Data**: `docs/project/issues-data.json` contains the structured data for all planned issues

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Issue Labels

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. Go to the "Actions" tab
3. Select the "Set Up Issue Labels" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Enter "yes" in the confirmation field
6. Click "Run workflow"

This will create all the standard labels defined in the `.github/labels.yml` file.

### Step 2: Create Initial Issues

Follow the [Issue Execution Guide](/docs/project/issue-execution-guide.md) for a concise checklist to create all issues. You can either:

- Use the automated script approach (recommended)
- Create issues manually using the templates and content provided

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Issue Implementation Guide](/docs/project/issue-implementation-guide.md).

### Step 3: Set Up Project Board (Optional)

To better visualize and manage the workflow:

1. Go to the "Projects" tab in the repository
2. Click "New project"
3. Select "Board" as the template
4. Add columns for "Backlog", "Ready", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done"
5. Add all created issues to the "Backlog" column

## üìã Issue Creation Workflow

The standard workflow for creating new issues is:

1. **Identify the need** for a new issue
2. **Select the appropriate template** (Feature Request, Bug Report, or General Issue)
3. **Complete the template** with detailed information
4. **Apply appropriate labels** from all required categories
5. **Add to project board** if using GitHub Projects
6. **Verify** the issue meets all quality standards using the verification checklist

## üîç Issue Management Best Practices

- **Be specific** with issue titles and descriptions
- **Include acceptance criteria** that are testable and verifiable
- **Apply consistent labels** according to the labeling system
- **Link related issues** to show dependencies
- **Update issue status** as it moves through the workflow
- **Document resolutions** when closing issues

## üìÜ Maintenance Schedule

To keep the issue management system effective:

- Review and update templates quarterly
- Audit issue quality monthly
- Adjust labels and workflows as needed based on team feedback
- Archive completed issues at project milestones
