## PR Update Summary

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Fixed devcontainer.json syntax errors
2. ✅ Installed missing dependencies (Jest)
3. ✅ Fixed failing tests:
   - Fixed UUID mocking in voting.test.js
   - Updated auto-workflow-improvements.test.js expectations
4. ✅ Removed WordPress-related files (3,284 files removed)
5. ✅ Created ESLint configuration
6. ✅ Fixed unreachable code issue in interaction-manager-unified.js
7. ✅ Added TODO comments to skipped tests per review feedback

### Review Comments Addressed:
- **Unreachable code issue**: Fixed by removing unnecessary return statement
- **Skipped test suites**: Added TODO comments explaining why tests are skipped and documenting the issues preventing them from running

### Current Status:
- ESLint: 16 errors, 817 warnings (stable)
- Tests: Most tests passing, some skipped with documented reasons
- CI/CD: One non-critical action failing (claude-code-action doesn't exist)
- Build: Successful

### Remaining Considerations:
- The skipped tests should be re-enabled once the underlying issues are resolved
- ESLint warnings could be addressed in a follow-up PR
- The claude-code-action workflow should be removed or fixed

The PR is ready for review with all critical issues resolved.
