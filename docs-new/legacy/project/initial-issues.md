## Next Steps

Once these initial issues are created and properly labeled, the next set of
issues should be prepared following the same format and organization. All issues
should follow the project's labeling conventions as outlined in the
[Issue Management Workflow](/docs/project/issue-management-workflow.md)
document.

For each issue, ensure the following labels are applied:

1. Type label (feature, bug, enhancement, documentation, task)
2. Priority label (priority:critical, priority:high, priority:medium,
   priority:low)
3. Component label (component:eventmanagement, component:datecoordination, etc.)
4. Status label (status:backlog)
