# Development Principles

## Core Philosophy

Our development approach prioritizes efficiency, quality, and sustainability. We
leverage modern tools and practices to maximize automation, maintain high code
quality, and ensure a smooth development workflow.

## Development Methodology

### Vibe Coding

- Utilize GitHub Copilot for efficient code generation
- Implement automated testing and code quality checks
- Generate pull requests with comprehensive reviews
- Focus on rapid, high-quality iteration

## Version Control Strategy

### Git and GitHub

- All code managed through Git version control
- GitHub used as the central repository platform
- Branch-based workflow with feature branches
- Pull request-based code review process
- Protected main branch with required reviews and passing tests

## CI/CD Implementation

### GitHub Actions

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments
- Visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency
- Notifications for build and deployment status

## Development Environment

### Local Development

- **Docker** or **Lando** for containerized development environments
- Consistent environment configuration across all developer machines
- Local environment that closely mirrors production

## Command-line Tools

### WP-CLI

- Automation of WordPress operations
- Custom WP-CLI commands for project-specific tasks
- Scripted database and content management

## Code Quality Standards

### Linters and Formatters

- **ESLint** for JavaScript code quality
- **Stylelint** for CSS/SCSS code quality
- **PHP_CodeSniffer** for PHP code quality (PSR-12)
- Automated formatting on pre-commit with **Husky**

### Coding Standards

- **PHP:** PSR-12 standard for all PHP code
- **JavaScript:** Follow ESLint configuration based on modern best practices
- **CSS/SCSS:** Follow BEM methodology for consistent class naming
- Comprehensive inline documentation and code comments

## Testing Strategy

### Multilevel Testing Approach

- **Unit Testing:** PHPUnit for PHP functions and Jest for JavaScript
- **Integration Testing:** Testing interactions between components
- **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress or Playwright for simulating user interactions
- **Visual Testing:** Storybook with Chromatic for UI components
- **Accessibility Testing:** Automated checks with Storybook add-ons and manual
  verification

## Documentation

- **Code Documentation:** Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Technical Documentation:** Markdown files in the repository
- **UI Component Documentation:** Storybook stories and documentation pages

## Performance Considerations

- Regular performance audits using Lighthouse
- Optimization of assets (images, JavaScript, CSS)
- Appropriate caching strategies
- Database query optimization

## Security Practices

- Strict input validation and output escaping
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Principle of least privilege for user roles

These principles guide all aspects of the development process and ensure a
high-quality, maintainable codebase that can evolve with the project's needs
over time.
